## MVP Model

MVP consists of three classes Model, View, and Presenter.

In MVP, 
- View and Model have a clearer separation.

- MVP, View is responsible for delegating input to Presenter.

- MVP, Presenter and View should have a 1-1 relationship, with each Presenter having a link to its View through the interface.

- MVP, View are linked to the Model directly through data bindings.

- Unit testing is easier, as the View knows the Presenter through an interface that can easily be mocked.
